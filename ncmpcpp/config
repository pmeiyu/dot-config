## Needed for tag editor and file operations to work.
##
mpd_music_dir = ~/Music
#
##### music visualizer #####
##
## Note: In order to make music visualizer work you'll need to use mpd fifo
## output, whose format parameter has to be set to 44100:16:1 for mono
## visualization or 44100:16:2 for stereo visualization. Example configuration
## (it has to be put into mpd.conf):
##
## audio_output {
##        type            "fifo"
##        name            "Visualizer Feed"
##        path            "/tmp/mpd.fifo"
##        format          "44100:16:2"
## }
##
#
visualizer_fifo_path = /tmp/mpd.fifo
#
##
## Note: Below parameter is needed for ncmpcpp to determine which output
## provides data for visualizer and thus allow syncing between visualization and
## sound as currently there are some problems with it.
##
#
visualizer_output_name = Visualizer Feed
#
##
## If you set format to 44100:16:2, make it 'yes'.
##
visualizer_in_stereo = yes
#
##
## Note: To enable spectrum frequency visualization you need to compile ncmpcpp
## with fftw support.
##
#
## Available values: spectrum, wave, wave_filled, ellipse.
##
#visualizer_type = spectrum
